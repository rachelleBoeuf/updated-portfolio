# LeBoeuf-Professional-Portfolio

## Objective

The main objective of this webpage is to have a DRY, error-free code written to produce a LIVE online personal portfolio. I can continue to add to and edit the portfolio indefinitely. An employer will be able to contact me directly from the webpage that I developed containing links to my projects as well as my resume. 

### Navigating through the Webpage

Feel free to interact with the page. Through Advanced CSS code, I was able to create a webpage with box shadows, transitioned hover effects, cursor changes, and links that a user can click on to view the Live projects.

#### Table of Contents

* ABOUT ME

The "About Me" Section on my webpage currently describes my creative ability to write more personal than professional details about my life until I have more relevant, professional experience (such as completing bootcamp or even my first month of bootcamp) to have employers read about. To jump down to that section without scrolling with your mouse or keyboard, simply click on the ABOUT ME text/link in the top right hand corner of the webpage. 

* MATERIAL

The "Material" section on my webpage hosts a few links to my completed projects, thus far. User should be able to see and click on selected project name/box to then be taken to that repository on GITHUB. To jump down to that section without scrolling with your mouse or keyboard, simply click on the ABOUT ME text/link in the top right hand corner of the webpage. 

* RESUME

The "Resume" section on my webpage has a placeholder image and alt text until I have an updated version of my resume that can go on this page. The alt-text should state, "Coming Soon! Updated Resume!". To jump down to that section without scrolling with your mouse or keyboard, simply click on the ABOUT ME text/link in the top right hand corner of the webpage. 

* CONTACT INFO

The "Contact Info" section on my webpage currently has just 1 link to my GITHUB account. If you click on the word GITHUB in the "Contact Info" section, the user will be taken to my GITHUB profile. To jump down to that section without scrolling with your mouse or keyboard, simply click on the ABOUT ME text/link in the top right hand corner of the webpage.
